# Podcasting Moves
For this assignment, I chose to compare two different fictional story podcasts:
1. _Homecoming_, Episodes 1-3
2. _The Orbiting Human Circus (of the Air)_, Episodes 1-2

Though both of these podcasts are considered to be story podcasts and can be categorized within the genre of fiction, they were both very different in terms of content and structure.
## Homecoming
The podcast _Homecoming_ could easily be described as a realistic fictional story. Each episode uses a dramatic shifting of music to articulate the next scene taking place and to create suspense. Between scenes, the podcast jumps back and forth in terms of chronology to keep the listeners engaged and guessing until their questions are answered. Though this organization may at first seem confusing for the reader to understand what is happening in the story, the simple interactions and dialogues in each scene are very easy to follow along with since they always involve Heidi and only one other main character at a time.

Since I've only listened to the first three episodes, it's difficult to tell exactly what kind of subgenre of fiction it is. The style, however, seems to suggest a suspenseful drama or mystery with the ominous piano music that often plays in between scenes, as well as before and after the narrative. Between all of the high-quality phone calls, interviews, and background noise, the auditory imagery helps dramatically engage the readers by setting them right in the scenes with Heidi.

Even though the story takes place in both the past and future, the somewhat subjective narration in this podcast, along with the simple transitioning of scenes, helps the story appear more realistic since the events that take place are rational and Heidi's character is relatable.

## The Orbiting Human Circus
The podcast _The Orbiting Human CIrcus (of the Air)_ is definitely more of a non-realistic fictional story. It was a little more difficult to take notes on compared to _Homecoming_ since the narration was constantly switching between the main characters of Julian the janitor, the narrator of Julian's life, and the announcer of the circus. This organization of the story contributed to the excitement of the story to help attract listeners' attentions. The voice of the narrator sounded very old-timey and described things with great elaboration for a suspenseful effect. Consistently strange, organ-like music played a part in the suspense as well.

The odd storyline was enhanced through the consistent transitioning of scenes and characters speaking. This use of many different scenes and characters made the story of this podcast very complex, and this style of storytelling may not be seen as effective as a storyline as simple as _Homecoming_. The sound effects, however, really helped make the story come to life through the auditory imagery, whether it was through Julian's footsteps, the sounds of him cleaning, or the sounds of an old television turning on.

Another very different stylistic approach, compared to _Homecoming_, is in the use of Julian's narrator's narration because he is constantly and thoroughly describing what Julian is doing instead of Julian talking about his actions.
